* Requirements:
- Vim
- Emacs

* Usage
This script probably won't work on windows. It's still not finished, but it
should work to some degree.

The theme to convert should be put in =~/.vim/colors=.

To use this script:
1. Run Emacs
2. Type =M-x load-file= and point it to =vimco.el= from this repository.
3. Type =M-x vimco-convert-vim-theme= and answer to the prompt with the name
   of the theme to be converted.
4. You will be prompted for the directory to save generated theme in. The
   default should be good enough.
